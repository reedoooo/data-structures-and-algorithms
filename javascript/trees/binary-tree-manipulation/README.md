# Code Challenge: BinaryTree Manipulation

The problem domain involves creating three classes to represent and manipulate binary trees. These include a Node class for storing individual data points and their connections, a Binary Tree class for housing a collection of these nodes and implementing depth-first traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, post-order), and a Binary Search Tree class that extends the Binary Tree class and adds methods for adding and checking the presence of values in the tree. Additionally, the specifications require the development of meaningful error handling and thorough testing.

## Approach & Efficiency

Define a Node class with properties for value, left, and right.
Define a BinaryTree class with methods for preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder traversals.
Define a BinarySearchTree class that extends BinaryTree and includes methods for add and contains.
Test for the following scenarios: instantiating an empty tree, instantiating a tree with a single root node, adding left and right children to a node, returning collections from all types of traversals, and checking the presence of values in the tree.
