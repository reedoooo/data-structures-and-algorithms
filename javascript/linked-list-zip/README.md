# Code Challenge 08: linked-list-zip

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

The goal is to zip two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the zipped list.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

The algorithm iterates through both lists simultaneously. If there is a node available from a list, it appends it to the end of the new zipped list and moves to the next node in the original list.

## Solution
