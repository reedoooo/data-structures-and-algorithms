## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create a Node class with properties for the value and the next node.
Create a Stack class with a top property that's initially set to null.
Implement methods for adding (push), removing (pop), checking the top element (peek), and checking if the stack is empty (isEmpty).
Create a Queue class with front and rear properties, both initially set to null.
Implement methods for adding (enqueue), removing (dequeue), checking the front element (peek), and checking if the queue is empty (isEmpty).
