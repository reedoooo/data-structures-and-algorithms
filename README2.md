## **II. Data Structures and Algorithms**

1. Basic Definitions:

   - k-ary Tree: A tree data structure with each node having no more than 'k' children.
   - Node: An entity that contains a value and links to other nodes.
   - Root: The starting node of a tree, with no parent.
   - Children: Nodes directly linked to a node.
   - Parent: The node which a node directly descends from in a tree data structure.
   - Leaf: A node with no children in a tree data structure.
   - Traversal: The process of visiting each node in a tree or graph exactly once.
   - Binary Search Tree: A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, with the left child node being less than the parent node and the right child node being greater.
   - Graph: A non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

2. Data Structures:

   - Map Data Structure: Holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.
   - HashMap: A structure that can map keys to values.
   - HashTable: A data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values.
   - LinkedList: A linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
   - Array: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
   - Binary Tree: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
   - Queue: A collection of elements that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
   - Stack: A collection of elements that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
   - Set: A collection of distinct items.

3. Algorithms and Complexity:
   - Big O Notation: A notation to describe the worst-case performance or complexity of an algorithm.
   - Time Complexity: Describes the amount of computer time taken by an algorithm to run.
   - Space Complexity: Describes the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes to run.
   - Binary Search Algorithm: Finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
   - Depth-First Traversal: A type of graph traversal that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - Breadth-First Traversal: A type of tree or graph traversal that explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to nodes at the next depth level.
   - Greedy Algorithms: Algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each stage.
   - Dynamic Programming: Solves a complex problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems.
   - Merge Sort Algorithm: A Divide and Conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them separately and then merges them.
   - Quick Sort Algorithm: Another Divide and Conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## **III. Graph Theory**

- Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge between two nodes has a direction.
- Undirected Graph: A graph in which an edge between two nodes does not have a direction.
- Vertex: A node in the graph.
- Edge: A connection between two nodes in a graph.
- Adjacency List: A representation of a graph as a map where each node stores a list of its neighbors.
- Weight: In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a value (weight).
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in depth-first order.
- Collision: When two different keys hash to the same index in a hash table.

## **IV. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

- Inheritance: A new class is derived from an existing class.
- Polymorphism: A name can be used for different types of related objects.
- Encapsulation: Bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.
- Class: A blueprint for creating objects.
- Object: An instance of a class.
- Method: A function associated with an object, or, put differently, a class's ability.

## **V. Software Testing**

- Unit Tests: Testing where individual components of software are tested.
- Integration Tests: Testing where multiple components are tested together.
- System Testing: A level of software testing where a complete and integrated software is tested.
- Edge Cases: Problems or situations that occur only at an extreme operating parameter.
- Jest: A JavaScript Testing Framework focusing on simplicity.

## **VI. Software Development Process**

- Problem Domain: Defines the problem and the elements representing the input, output, and processes in the problem statement.
- Requirements Gathering: The process of collecting the requirements from the end-user or client to clearly understand their expectations.
- Whiteboard Process: A planning process used in designing software.
- UML (Unified Modeling Language): A standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.

## **VII. Computer Systems**

- Operating Systems: Software that manages computer hardware and software resources.
- Computer Networks: A group of computers sharing resources over digital interconnections.
